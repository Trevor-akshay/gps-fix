Speed up Satellite fix for GPS on Android
Hello guys!I have heard lof of us face gps issues with  Android  so i have found a way to fix this issue easily just follow the steps carefully

Requirements:

Rooted Device

File Manager(solid explorer or miXplorer)

Steps:

I have modified the gps.config file to lock up much faster and also to update with movement in real time

1.download the modified gps.config and copy to your vendor/etc and paste it

2.Make sure the permission of the file is     *rw-r--r--

3.reboot the device

4.Use the app gps status and toolbox provided and follow the steps

A.Open app> tools> manage A-GPS state>Reset

B.Open app> tools> manage A-GPS state>Download

C.use GPS status to start fixing satellites

5.reboot the device

6.use an app called gps locker(available in playstore)  to lock satellites and make a proper connection

7.your gps must work now

Important Note:
After you lock your gps with the satellites if you wish to move from one area to other then use the gps locker app again to lock with the satellites again to make a proper working of gps
